* Financial data: such as income statements, balance sheet and cash flow statements which provide insight into the health of a company.


### Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data

IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment, All of these things' are connected to the internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And the given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it's no surprise that the emergence of IoT has led to and exponential growth in data, creating a new era of interest in technology and business called 'Big Data.'
